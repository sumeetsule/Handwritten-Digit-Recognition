# Handwritten Digit Recognition
<p>Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to build and fine-tune an MLP architecture for handwritten digit recognition, leveraging deep learning and neural network skills.</p><br> 
<p>Generated and analyzed the confusion matrix using Matplotlib to assess the classification accuracy of the MLP model.</p>
